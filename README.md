# Acey-Deucey
The classic lose all of your cash card game, 'Acey Deucey'. Also known as In-Between, and Red Dog. 

# Rank of Cards
A (high), K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A (low).

# Object of the Game
The goal is to be the player with the most chips at the end of the game.

# The Ante
50 Chips are distributed to the player, and the player puts one chip in the center of the table to form a pool or pot.


# The Betting
The player may bet up to the entire pot or any portion of the number of chips in the pot, but they must always bet a minimum of one chip. When the player has placed a bet, the dealer turns up the top card from the pack and places it between the two cards already face up. If the card ranks between the two cards already face up, the player wins and takes back the amount of his bet plus an equivalent amount from the pot. If the third card is not between the face-up cards, the player loses his bet, and it is added to the pot. If the card turned up is the same as either of the two face up cards, the player must re-pay their initial bet. If the two face-up cards are the same, the player wins two chips and, again, no third card is turned up. 

"Acey-Deucey" (ace, 2) is the best combination, and a player tends to bet the whole pot, if they can. This is because the only way an ace-deuce combination can lose is if the third card turned up is also an ace or a deuce.

After the first player has finished, the dealer clears away the cards and places them face down in a pile. The next player then places a bet, and the dealer repeats the same procedure until all the players, including the dealer, have had a turn.

If at any time, the pot has no more chips in it (because a player has "bet the pot" and won), each player again puts in one chip to restore the pot.

When every player has had a turn to bet, the deal passes to the player on the dealer's left, and the game continues.
